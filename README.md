# N-Puzzle-solver-program-assignment-2

## Input


#### Default
```
 n = 3
 initial_state = [0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6]

 n = 4
 initial_state = [1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 5, 6, 12, 11, 15, 0, 10, 9, 8, 7]
```
 
## Output
 
```
IDS Solution is  ['Right', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down']
Number of explored nodes is  224
IDS Spent Time: 0.005887031555175781
```

## Requirement
* (a) Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)
* (b) Uniform-Cost Search
* (c) Greedy Best-First Search
* (d) A* search
* (e) Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)

## Output for each algorithm
* (a) The number of movements (state changes) from the initial state to the goal state.
* (b) The maximum number of states ever saved in the memory during the process

#### Please explain the strategy you used in the search problem.
