# N-Queens-solver-program-assignment-2

## Input
```
Usage: [MODE]
  -random ${n}          n = >4 number
  -init_state ${state}  $state example: '0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0'
``` 

```

```
## Output
 
```
IDS Solution is  ['Right', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down', 'Down', 'Left', 'Up', 'Right', 'Down']
Number of explored nodes is  224
IDS Spent Time: 0.005887031555175781
```

## Requirement
* (a) Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS)
* (b) Uniform-Cost Search
* (c) Greedy Best-First Search
* (d) A* search
* (e) Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)

## Output for each algorithm
* (a) The number of movements (state changes) from the initial state to the goal state.
* (b) The maximum number of states ever saved in the memory during the process

#### Please explain the strategy you used in the search problem.
